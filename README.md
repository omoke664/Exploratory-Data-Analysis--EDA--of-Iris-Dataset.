Iris Flower Dataset Exploration
This Jupyter Notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris flower dataset, a classic benchmark dataset in machine learning.

Goal
The goal of this project is to gain insights into the Iris dataset by:

Loading the data
Understanding its structure and data types
Calculating summary statistics
Visualizing data distribution (histograms, boxplots)
Exploring relationships between features (pairplots)
Analyzing correlations between features
Dataset
The Iris dataset contains information about three iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) and their sepal and petal characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

Code
This Jupyter Notebook utilizes the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
The code performs the following steps:

Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
Creates a Pandas DataFrame from the data.
Adds the target variable (species) to the DataFrame.
Performs initial data exploration (data types, summary statistics).
Creates visualizations (histograms, boxplots, pairplots).
Calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix between features.
Running the Notebook
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
Open the notebook file (Iris_Flower_EDA.ipynb).
